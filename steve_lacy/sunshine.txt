Lookin’ like it’s all catchin’ up to you lately
Been a couple months since I told you it’s over
Caught me off guard when I saw you last week
Oh-so tough, but you bluffed when you had me
Sayin’, “My ex,” like my name ain’t Steve
Gave you a chance and some dopamine
Safe to say, after me, you peaked
Still I’ll give you dick anytime you need
Admit that I wasn’t lost
You’re taking it just as hard
Criticize me all you want
But I’m always gonna be
Where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be
Where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be, yeah
I took the high road, do it through every word
Is it still that special if the whole world has owned?
And you always chasin’, you can’t replace it
Put those feelings back where they came from
Why can’t we just get along? Or, at least, let’s get it on
Honestly, I wouldn’t mind, I would do it one more time
I would let you cut the line just so I could be right
Where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be
Where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be
(Where you are) where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be
Where you are
Where you are
But I’m always gonna be, yeah
I mean
If I’m always gonna be there, then I might as well
I don’t know about you, but, ah, come on
I still, I still love you
I still, I still love you
I still, I still love you
I still, I still love you
I still, I still love you (you, you, you)
I still, I still love you (you, you, you)
I still, I still love you (you, you, you)
I still, I still love you (you, you, you)
I still, I still love you
I still love you
You
I still love you
You
Love you
I still love you
I still love you, damn
This, this, this is love, I finally found it
