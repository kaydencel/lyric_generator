No, I don’t need an alibi
You saved my wrong, I’ll show you right
We kiss, we hug, we dance and fight
We laugh, make love, then we go all night
It’s such a thril to love you and it’s real
Roller coaster of emotions we feel
It’s such a thrill to love you and it’s real
Roller coaster of emotions we feel
Sometimes I hate you
Sometimes you kill
My move but I still
Manage to deal
You think I’m crazy, I could say the same
Perfect with each every year, we’re both insane
No, I don’t need an alibi
You saved my wrong, I’ll show you right
We kiss, we hug, we dance and fight
We laugh, make love, then we go all night
It’s such a thrill to love you and it’s real
Roller coaster of emotions we feel
It’s such a thrill to love you and it’s real
Roller coaster of emotions we feel
No, I don’t need an alibi
