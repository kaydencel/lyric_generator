# Abstract
For this final project, a song lyric generator was created that would take in songs from a single artist, and produce a new song that stayed true to the artistâ€™s style. Analyzing different areas of the music of four artists, the goal was to use weighted n-grams and sentiment analysis to generate a new song for each artist, and then use cosine similarity to visualize comparisons.
Additionally, we implemented weighted probabilities and rhyme schemes to create the generated lyrics.
